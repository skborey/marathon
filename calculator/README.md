# Calculator

#### Status: [FAILED]

#### Statistic: 1h

[5min]:
  - find UI
  - scope: 15min for functional, 15min for styling(css, layout)

[5min]:
  - Setup

[7min]:
  - finish service

[7min-43min]:
  - functional but struggle with logic how to handle UI
  - struggle with enum / type how to handle each operator input

#### Key take away

- make use understand the implement detail clear it first before implementation in first 5 min
- when starting create service but finally maybe not use it in future
- learn about `enum, type` how to check whether input string is one of the type e.g

```ts
type Operator = "+" | "-" | "*" | "%"

const input = "+"

// how we check input is type of Operator?

```
